## A simple selenium bot in Python, that plays the Google's 15th Birthday doodle.

The key is to get the timing between successive hits right.
Lots of uncertainity. Things may depend on your firefox.
I was personally able to score a max of 164 so far :p
Ya ya! you have scored more? Alright :x

The fun part, you sit back and relax and let the game play automatically, driven by this cool,simple code.
Its actually hard to get the timing right in code that to actually play the game.
But once you get the hardcoded timings right the code can replicate the score for you as many times you like. :)


##### Any suggestions on improving this both performance?

##### Any smart way to record 'hit timings' when you play as a human?

##### Any way to make your (javascript) actions into a macro so that you can run it all over again?
